## Hi, I'm Naina ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst enthusiast passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive decisions. I've worked on many real-world projects such as an E-commerce Analysis Dashboard and Customer Churn Analysis, where I built KPIs and find Insights. To strengthen my skills, I've also completed several certification courses in data analytics and visualizations.
